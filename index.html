                        <p>I was born on Febuary 11, 1983 in San Francisco California. I lived in San Franscico
                        until I was 10 and spent the rest of my childhood/teen life in a city
                        called Hercules. You may think its a huge city by the name of it, however it's just a small 
                        city where everyone knows each other. During my teens my hobbies were creating music, 
                        graphic designing, basketball, snowboarding, and fishing, however I took art and music more 
                        seriously. After high school I then atteneded a junior college which didn't pan out the way I wanted it to so I ended up getting full time job
                        for few years until I decided to go to The Conservatory of Recording Arts and Sciences
                        in 2011. Music has always been my passion and by attending the school it allowed me to be a better
                        audio engineer and gave me exposer to the industry. </p>

                    <div>
                        <p>After I graduated I interned at a professional studio called The Mix Room. There I learned
                        how studios operate on a day to day basis. I also had the opportunity to meet knowledgable 
                        engineers in the industry who gave me a few pointers as I sat in their sessions. After my intern 
                        I became a freelance audio engineer for a few years, however it was not consistent,
                        so I wanted the change my career paths. Being a creative and technical person, 
                        I wanted to try something new so I started my journey into becoming a web development.</p>
